> Container : virtual operating environment, with everything that 
yours software needs to run, includes libraries, system tools, code
and runtime

Docker cotainer : includes everything which micro service need 
to run

> container runs on docker host , which i the run time environment

Kubernetes
> open-source system for automating deployment , scaling ,
 and management of 
containerized application 
> deploys, manages, and maintains containers 
> It can restart ot replace failed container
> Deployment and updates : it can 100 0r 1000 of container 
  with a single command 

EKS : elatic kubernets service 
> it runs kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate 
your own kubernetes 

pod : group of one or more container ,with shared storage and network resources, and
      specifications for how to run the container

EKS is intergrated with other cloud services : 
 CloudTrail : logging of all user and API activity
 CloudWatch : Monitorinf an dclontrol plane logs
 IAM : authentication, auth, and permissions

 AWS installs and operates and maintains the kubernetes control plane 

 > EKS is fully compactible with the kubernetes tools and plugins  

 Creating a EKS cluster 
 1 . IAM user(creating a admin level user)
 2 . EC2 instance (run all the commands to create our cluster)
 3 . eksctl  (eksctl is a simple CLI tool for creating and managing clusters 


    > create a eks cluster and configure  the control plane
     on EKS - Amazon's managed Kubernetes service for EC2)
    > three worker nodes 
    > create a deployment > consisting pods and runnings in the pod, 
    using ngix image for the container
    >load balancer server to access the application form the outside world, expose
    the app on ineter 
4 . kubectl
